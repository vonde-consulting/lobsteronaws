# LOBSTER on AWS
 The beta version of LOBSTER engine developed by [frischedaten UG](https://lobsterdata.com) has been designed to
 utilize the powerful computation and storage capacity of Amazon AWS. It runs on top of Apache Spark,
 which are standard packages in [Amazon AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) release.
